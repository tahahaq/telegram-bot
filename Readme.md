Setup
First you need to create a Telegram bot. To do so you have to connect to BotFather and use the /newbot command. Then just follow the instructions. You will get a token that you will need in order to configure the bot:

npm install
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN="785710897:AAHPBwzEVPHE1XbhFYaytMYMpdonnBDczr0"
node index.js
